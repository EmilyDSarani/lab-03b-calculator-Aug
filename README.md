Overall Goal:
Need to create a calculator that adds, subtracts, multiples, and divides.
Focus on Add first and then copy from there.

HTLM
Create a button for the inputs. 
Maybe see if you can get them all on one button, but if not then go to separate. 

JS:
assign names to the function. For this assignment my arguments will be called Lit1 and Lit2. 
Create some sort of add function and export it to app.js from utils.js

Import from utils to apps. 
Then add and event listener

Let's see how it goes from there.
